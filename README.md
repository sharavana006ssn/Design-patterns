Introduction
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a template for solving problems that can be used in different situations. This repository aims to help developers learn and apply design patterns through practical examples.

Design Patterns Overview
Design patterns can be categorized into three main types:

Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

Structural Patterns: Ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.

Behavioral Patterns: Concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Creational Patterns
Examples of creational patterns include:

Singleton Pattern

Factory Method Pattern

Abstract Factory Pattern

Builder Pattern

Prototype Pattern

Structural Patterns
Examples of structural patterns include:

Adapter Pattern

Bridge Pattern

Composite Pattern

Decorator Pattern

Facade Pattern

Flyweight Pattern

Proxy Pattern

Behavioral Patterns
Examples of behavioral patterns include:

Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Command Pattern

Interpreter Pattern

Iterator Pattern

Mediator Pattern

Memento Pattern

Observer Pattern

State Pattern

Strategy Pattern

Template Method Pattern

Visitor Pattern
